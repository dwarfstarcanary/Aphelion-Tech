                <h1>Our Designers Decide: Top Three Most Popular Aesthetics</h1>
    
                <p>Our expert designers have voted on the top three most popular aesthetics that they have worked with. Check out their design profiles to see more!</p>
    
                <p>Aesthetics and themes are a great way to display your unique personality through your PC setup! With so many different options and evolving trends it can be hard to choose one. Here are some current popular themes to help you determine what aesthetic speaks to YOU.</p>
    
                <h2>The Neutral Option: All black or white.</h2>
    
                <p id="question"><b>You like to keep things fresh and change it up once in a while!</b></p>
    
                <p>Going for a neutral option eliminates having to match every single component! These builds give you more freedom to explore other color themes through the use of leds and other accessories. If you are someone who likes to change their aesthetic depending on different moods and seasons, this is the way to go! Play around with different types of lighting such as led accessories, galaxy projectors, neon signs, and lamps. Most notably, Wallpaper Engine offers easy RGB customization that matches all led components to the configured wallpaper! You can continue to adapt this space to match your niche and needs!</p>

                <h2>The Cozy Option: Creamy colors, wood, and ambient lighting.</h2>

                <p id="question"><b>You like a space that feels warm and welcoming after a long day.</b></p>

                <p>This setup prioritizes maximum comfort and is easy on the easy. For the homey vibe focus on ambient lighting by implementing lamps, fairy lights, candles, and warm toned colors. The ultimate color pairings for the neutral wood pattern include sage green, peach, and browns. Subtly including white can brighten up the space. Typical adornments include nature related accessories such as vines and plants. Diffusers and candles are a great way to add relaxing scents and emulate a peaceful cabin vibe. Grab a fuzzy blanket and a warm beverage for those long hours of cozy gaming.</p>

                <h2>The Kawaii Option: Bright pastels and cutesy accessories.</h2>

                <p id="question"><b>You like a space that is full of vibrant and you love showing off your favorite characters!</b></p>

                <p>The kawaii aesthetic focuses on maintaining a cutesy vibe that is definitive of the bright pastels. Pink is an essential color in this palette, but soft blues, purples, yellows, and white also work. Picking a character to base this aesthetic off of makes for a cute and cozy space, mostly notably My Melody, Kuromi, and Kirby. Iconic accessories include neon signs and leds, plushies, adorable figures, and comfy pillows. Matching peripherals such as headsets, mouse pads, mice, and keyboards are essential for that cohesive sweet look. Play around with displaying your favorite items! Peg boards are a cheap and easy way to do so without detracting from the aesthetic.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                <p>There are many different aesthetics and themes to choose from when it comes to designing your dream PC setup. We hope that this breakdown offers you the insight necessary to inspire an aesthetic that is representative of your unique personality.</p>

                <h1>PC Setup Tips</h1>
    
                <p> I remember when I was a kid in the early 2000’s and my parents came home with a Dell computer system. At that time it was the new hottest thing that made life ever more convenient. Modern day technology has enabled us to dream big beyond those blocky boring towers. The endless options can be overwhelming, from chassis to keyboard and desk accessories. Owning a computer has now adapted personalities and aesthetics of its own.</p>
                
                <h2> A Guideline to Help You Get Started </h2>
    
                <p> Here are some questions to consider before hitting the stores:</p>
    
                <ul>
                    <li id="question"><b>What is the intended use?</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Gaming?</b> - for high quality graphics and smooth gameplay</li>
                        <li><b>Workhorse?</b> - for efficiently running complex programs and having tons of hard drive space</li>
                        <li><b>Browsing?</b> - for leisurely activities that don’t require too much performance power</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li id="question"><b>What is the overall aesthetic?</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Color theme?</li>
                        <li>RGB lighting or blacked out?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li id="question"><b>What is the budget?</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>High end?</b> - $3,000 and above</li>
                        <li><b>Mid range?</b> - $900 - $3,000</li>
                        <li><b>Bang for buck?</b> - $800 and less</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li id="question"><b>What is the frame of space you're working with?</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Spacious?</li>
                        <li>In between?</li>
                        <li>Cozy?</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
    
                <h2>My Five Best Tips For Maintaining Your Setup</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><b id="question">Consistency is key!</b> - Sticking with one color theme creates a great ambiance! If you’re indecisive, I recommend going for black or white. Utilizing RGB leds in your build, accessories, and space can add a pop of color. Software programs such as Wallpaper Engine make it customizable for different aesthetics with just the click of a button.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b id="question">Cable management makes or breaks your setup!</b> - It can be overwhelming to look at a bunch of tangled wires around your space. Taking the extra time to tuck cables away so that they won’t get snagged on definitely makes all the difference: There are a few solutions to this:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Velcro Straps</li>
                            <li>Zip ties</li>
                            <li>Cable clips</li>
                            <li>Cable basket or boxes</li>
                            <li>Under desk cable raceways</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b id="question">Maintaining a clean setup!</b> - Taking care of your setup is crucial to ensuring the safety and longevity of the parts. It is recommended that a PC build is regularly dusted via an air duster while all components are powered down and unplugged. Dust build up can result in an overheating of the components which can lead to electrical fires.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b id="question">Pick comfy peripherals!</b> - When it comes to keyboards, mice, headsets, and gaming chairs, choose the one that feels best to you. Everyone has a different preference when it comes to how snug they like their headsets. Keyboards and mice have different sound levels and hand-feel depending on how you like to use them. A comfy gaming chair with back support is ideal for those many hours at your desk.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b id="question">Accessorize your desk space!</b> - Have fun with your desk space and don’t be afraid to let your personality shine. From toy figures, posters, mouse pads, and led gadgets, the possibilities are endless.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                <p>There are many different factors that go into creating a setup and maintaining it. We hope that this breakdown offers you the insight necessary to inspire the setup of your dreams. Find the aesthetic that fits your needs and your budget.</p>
